# ECourse-File-Type-Checker
This program is used to check what type of course is being submitted. 
When an e-course is submitted, the file is in .zip format. An administrator can't tell by looking in what schema the ecourse was exported. The Open ZIP File button displays the file select dialog. The ZIP file is then opened and checked for various markers to know the schema.The schema type is displayed in a label to the end user.
